# [5.5.0](https://github.com/jaeiya/wakitsu/compare/v5.4.1...v5.5.0) (8/7/2023)

### What to Watch Improvement

Instead of having to find the file and execute it manually yourself, the `-wtw` flag now prompts you to select a number correlating to a listed anime. Selecting a number will execute the anime on file using your default media player.

Once you finish watching the anime and close the media player, you will be prompted to auto-update the progress for the anime you just watched. If you happen to close the media player before finishing the anime, you can skip the update process.

This means watching anime got a LOT more intuitive. You no longer have to look at files or type in a bunch of commands to update their progress. You can simply type `wak -wtw`, select an anime, watch it, then let it auto-update your progress; it's dead simple.

**Caveat**
Of course there's one exception to the rule, and that's how an anime is referenced on file. In order for this command to work, you first need to watch the episode the old way, where you manually enter the name, this is because the file name could be too different from the anime title. Once the first episode of an anime has been "watched", you can start using the `-wtw` flag for all subsequent episodes.

# [5.3.0](https://github.com/jaeiya/wakitsu/compare/v5.2.0...v5.3.0) (7/30/2023)

## Auto-Watch

The default way to watch anime has **not** changed, but it now has a subtle new feature. Instead of typing an anime title and episode number, you can now simply type the title. This comes with some pros and cons. First of all let me demonstrate how this works below:

```bash
wak 'title or title keyword'
```

### The Pros

- Anime that would normally need a forced episode, will now just progress as expected
- Reduced friction when updating anime, since you only need some of the title

### The Cons

- We had to make some assumptions. The first assumption is that anime will always be watched in order, from beginning to end.
  - This means that if for some reason you're starting in the middle of a season, you'll have to update your anime the normal way first.
- The second assumption: all files are from the same fansub group. If you mix and match fansubs for the same anime series, this method will fail to find the correct file to move.

### Why?

So, why did I think this feature was worth adding? This feature would probably have never made it in, if it wasn't for the increased frequency of fansubs not resetting episode numbers for subsequent seasons of an anime.

If the episodes were defined internally (from the studio) as being incremented from the last episode in the season, then it wouldn't be an issue, but fansub groups have decided to inconsistently decide this for themselves. The studio numbering and fansub numbering no longer have parity; this is why we have a `forcedEp` number to begin with.

## Features

- **flags**: new `--anime` flag is a combination of both the **add** and **find** anime operations ([01f3e2a](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/01f3e2a))
- **flags**: new `--anime drop` feature allows you to drop anime ([c178d43](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/c178d43))
- **flags**: new `--dir` flag combines directory info and cleaning functionality ([5f0fd8c](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/5f0fd8c))
- **flags**: `--cache` flag now combines rebuild and display functionality ([1118f4f](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/1118f4f))
- **flags**: `--profile` flag now combines rebuild and display functionality ([3020b33](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/3020b33))

## Minor Changes

- **printer**: main headers are underlined ([5ee84df](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/5ee84df))
- **printer**: the prompt has a new look which separates itself from all other messages ([e1b6c0f](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/e1b6c0f))
- **flags**: `--clean` now displays a loader animation and header, along with how much space was cleared
- **rss**: removed bitrate display and added raw file display; reduced complexity of fansub parsing ([ed0bd8e](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/ed0bd8e))

## Fixes

- **flags**: `--dir` will no longer break when the directory is empty ([c7373bd](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/c7373bd), [6926afd](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/6926afd))

# [5.2.0](https://github.com/jaeiya/wakitsu/compare/v5.1.0...v5.2.0) (7/21/2023)

### Update Anime without Files

The `-m` and `--manual` flags have been added to make sure you can update your anime watch list without needing to have a file on disk. I'm not sure why this took so long, but here it is...ðŸ˜…

It works just like the default command syntax:

```bash
wak 'anime title' epNum forcedEpNum
```

The only difference is you use it with the `-m` flag:

```bash
wak -m 'boku no hero' 13 1
```

### Features

- **flag**: new `--add-anime` flag, which allows you to selectively add new anime to your watch list. You can execute `wak -h add anime` to get more info. ([c4a8b66](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/c4a8b66), [b0c20d8](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/b0c20d8), [ae9d46c](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/ae9d46c))
- **flag**: add hour-accuracy to `--token` expiration calculation ([9324201](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/9324201))
- **flag**: `--rss` now displays your search terms ([c2e49d5](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/c2e49d5))
- **console**: rewrote the logging class, allowing for an easier text-formatting experience and more logging features. All menus and logs now have a new look to them. ([8a62b04](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/8a62b04))
- **cli**: decouple flag-help from CLI interface and embed help in the flags themselves using the new `Printer{}` ([c5c7cd5](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/c5c7cd5))
- **kitsu**: every time an anime is updated, the _auth-token_ will be checked to see if it's about to expire. If it is, the user will be notified. ([849d737](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/849d737))
- **kitsu**: if a username is not found during setup, it will now keep prompting for one ([41fe9e4](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/41fe9e4))
- **help**: show full help, instead of syntax help, when `wak` is executed with no arguments ([4e1c2a4](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/4e1c2a4))
- **flag**: updated `--help` description to be more verbose ([0542ecd](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/0542ecd))
- **watch**: added better message display when multiple anime are found having the same name ([be6c9b0](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/be6c9b0))

### Minor Changes

- **flags**: `--color` "on" text is now highlighted bright green ([1dae2cd](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/1dae2cd))
- **config**: we no longer display a message every time the config is saved ([e8c55db](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/e8c55db))

### Fixes

- **watch**: english title missing default value ([d82af6b](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/d82af6b))
- **flags**: use bang for both test flag names ([33d3548](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/33d3548))
- **kitsu**: provide a default empty string for all titles ([6bac527](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/6bac527))
- **utils**: remove strict `-` fansub parsing. This allows us to match a lot more fansub groups ([6af5d82](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/6af5d82))

# [5.1.0](https://github.com/jaeiya/wakitsu/compare/v5.0.0...v5.1.0) (4/12/2023)

### Features

- **flag**: `--find-anime` can find anime using synonyms (alt title) ([75bfa4a](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/75bfa4a))

### Minor Changes

- **utils**: support dashes in fansub filenames
- **flag**: `--find-anime` now includes synonym (alt title) and synopsis display ([c229256](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/c229256))
- **kitsu**: no longer store synopsis in cache ([206ff5c](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/206ff5c))

### Fixes

- **watch**: support dashes and spaces in fansub group names ([d5547b4](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/d5547b4), [f74b377](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/f74b377))
- **rss**: the "latest entry" was not always the latest entry ([534ac77](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/534ac77))
- **kitsu**: set the default English title to empty string if the API returned undefined ([0444913](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/0444913))

# [5.0.0](https://github.com/jaeiya/wakitsu/compare/v4.1.0...v5.0.0) (4/5/2023)

### Breaking Changes ([5fcd844](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/5fcd844))

Unfortunately, yes, we're here again with some breaking changes, but there was absolutely no getting around it this time; title synonyms (alternative titles) could potentially be used as file names. Those titles are not always words or phrases within the official title, which means we had to add this property into Kitsu's cache, which always requires a deleting of the config file ðŸ¥º.

### Features

- **flags**: `--find-anime` now displays synonyms (alt titles) and partial synopsis ([c229256](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/c229256))
- **flags**: `--find-anime` supports finding an anime by its synonym (alt title) ([75bfa4a](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/75bfa4a))
- **watch**: support finding an anime file name by its synonym (alt title) ([5fcd844](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/5fcd844))

### Minor Changes

- **kitsu**: no longer store synopsis in cache ([206ff5c](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/206ff5c))
- **utils**: support `v2` in fansub file names ([8e192ff](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/8e192ff))

# [4.1.0](https://github.com/jaeiya/wakitsu/compare/v4.0.1...v4.1.0) (4/4/2023)

### Features

- **flags**: add `clean` flag to delete files in watched directory ([d08bc6e](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/d08bc6e))
- **watch**: remove "subsplease" file restrictions ([bab48ee](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/bab48ee))
- **rss**: remove "subsplease" search restrictions ([dfa5bb1](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/dfa5bb1))
- **flags**: `rss` flag now displays all relevant file name information and truncates title ([f68aadb](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/f68aadb))
- **utils**: strict fansub file name parsing ([bab48ee](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/bab48ee), [edfd27a](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/edfd27a))
- **watch**: delete anime from cache when last episode is watched ([a1ac244](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/a1ac244))
- **flags**: when using the `find anime` flag, it now displays the Kitsu anime profile link ([de0e27e](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/de0e27e))

### Minor Changes

- **flags**: added header to various flag display methods

### Fixes

- **kitsu**: there's a flaw in Kitsu's slug algorithm so we have to manually replace chars ([98328ef](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/98328ef))
- **rss**: entry count off by 1 (this is probably not the correct solution) ([c0ba302](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/c0ba302))

# [4.0.1](https://github.com/jaeiya/wakitsu/compare/v4.0.0...v4.0.1) (3/6/2023)

#### Fixes

- Color configuration not initialized properly ([d10f99c](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/d10f99c))
- Color configuration incorrectly defaulted to false ([c9072fe](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/c9072fe))

# [4.0.0](https://github.com/jaeiya/wakitsu/compare/v3.0.0...v4.0.0) (3/6/2023)

### Breaking Changes ([dd0fd42](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/dd0fd42))

The structure of the config file has been changed yet again, but this time it should be a lot more resilient with future updates. After this update, any changes to the config, will first check if a default value can be applied, and if so, it updates the config automatically.

Unfortunately, this time around, you'll need to delete your `wakitsu.json` config file.

### Deprecations

- **flags**: `-rt` and `--refresh-token` have been removed in favor of the new `-t` and `--token` flags

### Features

- **flags**: add `-t` and `--token` flags to allow refreshing, resetting, and displaying token information ([6330710](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/6330710))
- **flags**: add `-cl` and `--color` flags to allow toggling console color on/off ([69cbf26](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/69cbf26))
- **watch**: update episode count after each watch execution (Kitsu does not always have an accurate episode count until later in a series) ([d4bd666](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/d4bd666))
- **--profile**: added number of series currently being watched ([c98208a](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/c98208a))
- **--profile**: added how much time it will take to watch remaining series ([0ef3fe7](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/0ef3fe7))
- **cache**: now stores `slug`, `synopsis`, and `episode progress` information ([5eea47b](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/5eea47b), [7f3b4a9](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/7f3b4a9))
- **config**: added resiliency to configuration updates ([dd0fd42](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/dd0fd42))

### Minor Changes

- **config**: move configuration into its own Class and use it as a global state for the application ([d8a3e19](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/d8a3e19))

### Fixes

- **kitsu**: save token expiration when token is refreshed ([e7bf773](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/e7bf773))

# [3.0.0](https://github.com/jaeiya/wakitsu/compare/v2.0.1...v3.0.0) (2/28/2023)

### Breaking Changes ([3d5b335](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/3d5b335))

The `wakitsu.json` configuration file will now store the auth token expiration date. This means that you'll need to delete your existing `wakitsu.json` before you can use this version. In a future update, this expiration date will be used to determine when you need to refresh your auth token.

Authentication tokens, **once expired**, no longer allow you to refresh them. So it's very important to know when it's about to expire.

### Features

#### Console Logger ([30406d8](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/30406d8), [49e5f35](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/49e5f35))

This module has been effectively re-written, in order to make coloring the text a bit more intuitive and less cumbersome. It now also supports custom colors, which will be implemented in future updates.

### Changes

- **cli**: add animated loading log for longer running processes ([79be9726](https://github.com/jaeiya/wakitsu/commit/79be972650ebbedf308c64752592ba1dd8f330a5))
- **default-flag**: add another help alias ([0ac2ce6e](https://github.com/jaeiya/wakitsu/commit/0ac2ce6e02ab7ba5d44ee23d4b4fea8b1c3eae2a))
- **utils**: `tryCatchAsync()` is now more type-safe ([ceb15dca](https://github.com/jaeiya/wakitsu/commit/ceb15dca5c06057fb9668d9b719550ce5c42ba0e))

### Fixes

- **kitsu**: not all API errors were handled properly ([ff890ca](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/ff890ca))
- **kitsu**: zod failed parse when user not found ([8aea34b](https://github.com/Jaeiya/aniwatch/commit/8aea34b))

# [2.0.1](https://github.com/jaeiya/wakitsu/compare/v2.0.0...v2.0.1) (2/19/2023)

### Changes

- **chore**: update all dependencies ([145fd856](https://github.com/jaeiya/wakitsu/commit/145fd8567df5931591b4e93906d1c7371e48d3fb))
- **kitsu**: save config files as `wakitsu.json` instead of `aniwatch.json` ([421c0049](https://github.com/jaeiya/wakitsu/commit/421c00494c1e4ffcfae0261512325cdc8108104b))
- all help has been updated to use new `wakitsu` name and `wak` command name ([3f2cc469](https://github.com/jaeiya/wakitsu/commit/3f2cc4691e53b72e5a438d10b8bf3cad09c722d2))

# [2.0.0](https://github.com/jaeiya/wakitsu/compare/v1.3.1...v2.0.0) (2/19/2023)

### Project Rename

As you read through the changelog, you'll see that the program is referred to as "aniwatch". With this update, the project has been renamed to "wakitsu". From now on, you can access this program using the `wak` command instead of `aniwatch`.

### Breaking Changes

This update comes with a new configuration schema design, which removes the need for an `.aniwatch.cache` file. The cache is now built right into the `aniwatch.json` file. Because of this change, if you're missing the new cache object, the program will error out.

The solution is to simply delete your `aniwatch.json` file and let the program re-authenticate you. This will rebuild the cache, as well as all other relevant data. **This will have no effect on your Kitsu data.** Your Kitsu data is safely stored on Kitsu itself.

### Public Release

You can now install this package from NPM `npm i wakitsu`. I wasn't planning on making this package public, but if others can benefit from it the way I have, then why not. I'm sure this is a pretty niche use-case to begin with, so...I doubt there will be that much traction.

### "Watched" folder analytics

Added new `-dir` flag that displays folder analytics for the "watched" folder. Most of the statistics are fairly arbitrary, but some of them can be useful, especially the one telling you how large the 'watched' folder is. If you don't have a very big hard drive, that stat might clue you in that you need to delete some files.

Some other stats are: the oldest file, the newest file, and the largest file. Admittedly this was more of a "fun" feature to add, than a necessity.

### Minor Features

- store total episode count in cache and display it as part of a successful "watch" execution ([48a11f24](https://github.com/jaeiya/wakitsu/commit/48a11f24d4eb5221ba44fc000186e85e796934c1))
- add this changelog ([5871d42d](https://github.com/jaeiya/wakitsu/commit/5871d42d5ea96903be15589293de0f33e9bfb762))

### Fixes

- **watch**: do not exit when creating watched directory ([a985095a](https://github.com/jaeiya/wakitsu/commit/a985095aefe6ba2501663f79316f017e0034a8f6))

# [1.3.1](https://github.com/jaeiya/wakitsu/compare/v1.3.0...v1.3.1) (2/14/2023)

### Changes

- **default-flag**: add more help aliases for "how to watch" anime help ([8b8fac21](https://github.com/jaeiya/wakitsu/commit/8b8fac21e829ee66ed0adbd5f60e56f195362bb3))

### Major CLI internal re-write

Flags are now compartmentalized within their own objects and registered as such, into the CLI. This allows for flag data (aliases, help aliases, short description, etc...) to be created together, rather than strewn over multiple files.

# [1.1.1](https://github.com/jaeiya/wakitsu/compare/v1.1.0...v1.1.1) (1/31/2023)

### Features

- **help**: add more robust explanation on how help works ([32f769c4](https://github.com/jaeiya/wakitsu/commit/32f769c4a021fc5065328cc05f236bfbfdd32808))
- **help**: add more help aliases for flag discoverability ([92c0ffaf](https://github.com/jaeiya/wakitsu/commit/92c0ffaf573a3d43609e00f557ac4df2e5c7fbff), [25436697](https://github.com/jaeiya/wakitsu/commit/254366976f47c2f712ff2a617beea6abc74aa964))

### Fixes

- **help**: using incorrect alias for "rebuild-profile" flag ([543554ef](https://github.com/jaeiya/wakitsu/commit/543554efce852e062ed4eed39392a0047e4197d2))

# [1.1.0](https://github.com/jaeiya/wakitsu/compare/v1.0.2...v1.1.0) (1/30/2023)

### Full Help Support

Documented all features of the program, which are available through the help flag. You can use `aniwatch -h` to get started. Help aliases were also added as a new way to find help.

You can use `aniwatch -h find anime` or `aniwatch -h show profile` respectively for learning how to find anime or display your Kitsu profile. It should be fairly easy to figure out, within a couple words, how to find help for a feature of the program.
